#519# This is your ship

Hold right mouse button and drag the mouse to rotate a view
#520# You may pan the view by press and hold middle mouse button and drag the mouse
#521# Use mouse scroll wheel to zoom
#522# You may reset view to default position by pressing highlighted button
#523# Now about movement

You may rotate your ship by keys A and D. Try to rotate your ship a bit left and right.
#524# Note that your ship is located in a vacuum, there is no air friction, so it will keep its linier and angular velocity until you stop it manually.
#525# Automatic stabilization is very useful if you want to stop rotation of your ship. Activate stabilizor by pressing the highlighted button or its hotkey
#526# While stabilizer is active, it will automatically uses engines to stop rotation of the ship.

However, make note, that your fuel is limited. These basic maneuvering engines consume liquid hydrogen. Your current amount of liquid hydrogen is displayed on the screen (highligthed by arrow)
#527# While stabilizer is active, it will stop rotation everytime, even if you don't really need it, this will increase the consumption of fuel, so it could be useful to disable stabilizer if you don't need it.

Disable stabilizer by pressing R hotkey.
#528# Now try to move your ship a bit using keys W S Q E to move it forward, backward, left and right.
#529# Now zoom out a camera and observe the nearest planet and its surroundings.

You probably noticed that your ship does not stay in one place. The ship rotates on an orbit around the planet.
#530# Despite the orbital mechanic, in this game, movement is much simplier than in real world.

Let's try to approach a nearby asteroid.
Select the highlighted asteroid by mouse click.
#531# Now display relative velocity
#532# While this tool is active and you have selected an object(s), you will see two arrows near your ship.

White arrow - direction to selected target
Orrange arrow - velocity vector of your ship relative to selected target
#533# Now, in order to approach to selected target, begin to move your ship toward it.

You need to align the orrange arrow with the white arrow.
#534# Good. Once the two arrows aligned, it means that your ship moves right toward the target.

Keep an eye on the distance to target. Do not crash into it.
Once you approach, decelerate your ship until the yellow arrow becomes very short. It means that your relative velocity is almost zero.

Approach to selected target and stop near it.
#535# Good. Let's try again for another asteroid.
#536# Move your ship to highlighted asteroid.
#537# And one more time.

Move your ship to highlighted asteroid.
#538# Perfect! Now you know how to approach objects located not too far from your ship.
#539# Now let's mine some resources in order to sell them and earn credits.

Your ship already equipped with a mining laser. In order to activate it, select the mining laser and press button "Toggle" in the window.

Note that mining laser consumes energy which is displayed in right-top corner of the screen, so disengage a laser when it is not pointed at an asteroid.

Now mine a nearby asteroid using the mining laser and gather some resources.
#540# During mining, you will see an indicator that shows output.
Note, the closer mining laser to the asteroid, the more effective it is.

Now open the cargo interface.
#541# In this mode you may see a content of any storage on your ship.
Here you may see a fuel, energy and gathered ore.

You may move resources from one container to another by dragging and dropping. But it is not neccesary for now, so just disable the cargo interface.
#542# New space station just arrived in the star system.

Let's dock with the station and refuel your ship.
Select highlighted space station.
#543# Request permission for docking
#544# The station will reserve a free docking port for your ship.

Approach to designated docking port and accurately touch it with your the docking port on your ship.
#545# Now open the trading panel
#546# In this window, locate "Hydrogen" and press "Buy", after that, select the desired amount, for example 10 and confirm the order.

Also, here you can sell gathered resources. Try it.
#547# Now let's test a weapon

Your ship doesn't have a weapon, so you need to extend your ship.
Later you will be able to construct modules using engineering bay, but for now you can buy new modules from the station.

Select the station and press "Shipyard" button.
#548# In the menu, select turret platform.

You will see mounting points on your ship. Place a turret anywhere where you want.
#549# Now select a cannon from the list and attach it on top of your turret platform.
#550# Good. In order to use a cannon, you need ammo.

Buy ammo from the station using "Trade" button.
#551# After you've bought ammo, you should connect your cannon to the storage where it should take ammo.

Open the resource connection manager.
#552# In this mode you will see a lines which represents the flow of resources.

Many devices should be conencted to storages in order to work. Engines should be connected to fuel tanks. Shield generators should be connected to power storages, etc.

Now connect a cannon to the container with ammo by dragging and dropping line from the grey dot to the container.
#553# Now you may undock from the station.

In order to undock, select your docking port and press the button in its control panel.
#554# Turrets may be operated manually or you may activate automatic mode.

Let's try manual control.
Select a turret and press "Manual control".
Also you may press "Show range" in order to enable interface.
#555# Try to make several test shots and press next.
#556# You have completed the basic tutorial.

If you need additional information, check the guide from the community.
#557# You have arrived in the star system, you have a small mining ship, a little hydrogen in the fuel tanks, which is enough for a flight to the nearest asteroids and stations. Use your mining laser to gather resources from an asteroids, and sell it to the nearest trading station.

Modify your ship with the shipyard and perform missions in order to improve your reputation and get an access to new modules.
